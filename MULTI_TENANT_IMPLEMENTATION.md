# Multi-Tenant Product Management Implementation

## Overview

This implementation converts the Laravel ProductController to support multi-tenancy where each user has their own company/business. Each user can only access, create, update, and delete their own products.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `database/migrations/2025_01_27_000000_add_user_id_to_products_table.php`
- **Purpose**: Adds `user_id` foreign key column to products table
- **Features**: 
  - Foreign key constraint with cascade delete
  - Index for performance optimization

### 2. Product Model Updates
- **File**: `app/Models/Product.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `user_id` to `$fillable` array
  - Added `user()` relationship method
  - Added `scopeForUser()` query scope for cleaner queries

### 3. ProductPolicy for Authorization
- **File**: `app/Policies/ProductPolicy.php`
- **Purpose**: Handles all authorization logic for product operations
- **Methods**:
  - `viewAny()`: Users can view their own products
  - `view()`: Users can only view their own products
  - `create()`: Authenticated users can create products
  - `update()`: Users can only update their own products
  - `delete()`: Users can only delete their own products

### 4. ProductController Multi-Tenant Implementation
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php`
- **Key Features**:
  - **CREATE**: Auto-assigns authenticated user's ID to new products
  - **READ**: Only shows products belonging to authenticated user
  - **UPDATE**: Only allows updating user's own products
  - **DELETE**: Only allows deleting user's own products
  - **Authorization**: Uses Laravel's built-in authorization system
  - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all scenarios
  - **Validation**: Enhanced validation rules with minimum values

### 5. AuthServiceProvider Registration
- **File**: `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php`
- **Purpose**: Registers ProductPolicy with Laravel's authorization system

### 6. Route Updates
- **File**: `routes/api.php`
- **Changes**: Fixed route method names to match controller methods
- **Protection**: All product routes are protected by `auth:sanctum` middleware

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication via Laravel Sanctum tokens.

### GET /api/products
- **Purpose**: List all products for authenticated user
- **Response**: Array of products with user_id included
- **Authorization**: Uses `viewAny` policy method

### POST /api/products
- **Purpose**: Create a new product for authenticated user
- **Body**: `name`, `price`, `unit_cost` (optional), `bulk_cost` (optional)
- **Features**: Auto-assigns user_id from authenticated user
- **Authorization**: Uses `create` policy method

### GET /api/products/{id}
- **Purpose**: Get specific product details
- **Authorization**: Uses `view` policy method
- **Security**: Only returns products belonging to authenticated user

### PUT /api/products/{id}
- **Purpose**: Update a product
- **Body**: Any combination of `name`, `price`, `unit_cost`, `bulk_cost`
- **Authorization**: Uses `update` policy method
- **Security**: Only allows updating user's own products

### DELETE /api/products/{id}
- **Purpose**: Delete a product
- **Authorization**: Uses `delete` policy method
- **Security**: Only allows deleting user's own products

## Security Features

### 1. User Scoping
- All queries are scoped to the authenticated user
- Uses `Product::where('user_id', $request->user()->id)` pattern
- Leverages `scopeForUser()` for cleaner queries

### 2. Authorization Checks
- Every operation checks authorization via policies
- Uses `$this->authorize()` method for consistent authorization
- Proper error responses for unauthorized access

### 3. Input Validation
- Enhanced validation rules with minimum values
- Proper error handling for validation failures
- Consistent error response format

### 4. Error Handling
- Specific handling for different exception types:
  - `ValidationException`: 422 status with validation errors
  - `ModelNotFoundException`: 404 status for not found
  - `AuthorizationException`: 403 status for unauthorized
  - General exceptions: 500 status with error details

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(8,2) NOT NULL,
    unit_cost DECIMAL(8,2) NULL,
    bulk_cost DECIMAL(8,2) NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX (user_id)
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Product
```bash
curl -X POST /api/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sample Product",
    "price": 29.99,
    "unit_cost": 15.00,
    "bulk_cost": 12.00
  }'
```

### Getting User's Products
```bash
curl -X GET /api/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### Updating a Product
```bash
curl -X PUT /api/products/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "price": 34.99
  }'
```

## Migration Instructions

1. Run the migration to add user_id column:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. If you have existing products, you'll need to assign them to users or remove them:
   ```sql
   -- Option 1: Assign all existing products to a default user (replace 1 with actual user ID)
   UPDATE products SET user_id = 1 WHERE user_id IS NULL;
   
   -- Option 2: Delete all existing products (if no data preservation needed)
   DELETE FROM products;
   ```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and authorization checks. Test scenarios should include:

1. **Authentication**: Ensure all endpoints require valid tokens
2. **Authorization**: Verify users can only access their own products
3. **Validation**: Test with invalid data and edge cases
4. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error responses for all scenarios
5. **Multi-User**: Test with multiple users to ensure data isolation

## Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of data between users
2. **Security**: Robust authorization and validation
3. **Scalability**: Efficient queries with proper indexing
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code with proper error handling
5. **Laravel Best Practices**: Uses Laravel's built-in features for authorization and relationships
